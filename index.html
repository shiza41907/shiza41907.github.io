        <p>Internet backbone is one of the principle data routes that is found between large, strategically 
interconnected computer networks and core routers.</p>

    <h2>Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms, outlining how this 
protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships.</h2>
        <p>When computers connect and transmit data between each other, they have to follow a set of rules to do 
so. These rules are made unviersally so that all computers can use them. These rules are called protocols.
There are many different protocols made for different purposes. 'Internet Protocol Suite' is the term we 
use to refer to the protocols all together. The two most important protocols are Transmission Control 
Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), which helps in making sure that data is delivered at the 
correct place without any errors.</p>
    <h2>List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Websites (ie: Instagram or Pinterest websites)</li>
        <li>File transfer protocol</li>
        <li>Video Conferencing (ie: Google Meet)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is hypertext?</h2>
        <p>Hypertext is a text that contains links to other texts, information or graphics. These texts
can be typically accessed by the point-and-click method.</p>
    <h2>How is “the web” related to the internet?</h2>
        <p>"The web" is used on top of the infrastructure of the internet, in that "the web", also 
referred to as the World Wide Web, is a collection of information that is accessed via the internet.</p>
    <h2>How is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used to facilitate client/server interaction?
