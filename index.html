    <h2>Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms, outlining 
        how this protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server 
        relationships.</h2>
        <p style="color : rgb(0,0,128); text-indent: 5%; font-size:20px;">When computers connect and transmit data 
        between each other, they have to follow a set of rules to do so. These rules are made 
        universally so that all computers can use them. These rules are called protocols. There are 
        many different protocols made for different purposes. 'Internet Protocol Suite' is the term 
        we use to refer to the protocols all together. The two most important protocols are 
        Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), which helps in making sure that data is delivered at the
        correct place without any errors.</p>
        <h2>List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships.</h2>
    <ol>
        <li style="color : rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px">Websites (ie: Instagram or Pinterest websites)</li>

    <h2>What is hypertext?</h2>
        <p style="color : rgb(0,0,128); text-indent: 5%; font-size:20px">Hypertext is a text that contains links to other texts, information
        or graphics. These texts
        can be typically accessed by the point-and-click method.</p>
    <h2>How is “the web” related to the internet?</h2>
        <p style="color : rgb(0,0,128); text-indent: 5%; font-size:20px">The web" is used on top of the infrastructure of the internet, in
        that "the web", also referred to as the World Wide Web, is a collection of information that is accessed via the internet.</p>
    <h2>How is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used to facilitate client/server interaction?</h2>
        <p style="color : rgb(0,0,128); text-indent: 5%; font-size:20px">The HTTP client (a browser is an example) intiates a HTTP request
        towards the server. Once the request is made,the client waits for the response. The server then
        processes the request by displaying the requested objects. This means that if the client makes 
        a request for HTML pages towards the server, then the server will request the process by 
        displaying the requested HTML pages.</p>

    <h2>Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0,
        and Web 3.0 generational paradigms.</h2>
        <p style="color : rgb(0,0,128); text-indent: 5%; font-size:20px">Web 1.0, also referred to 
        Syntactic web or the 'read-only web' is a type of web that existed in the era of 1990-2000. 
        Web 1.0 only gave the ability for the user to read the information provided by the content 
        producers. This web was designed to help people find better information. It is referred to 
        as the 'read-only web' because it lacks the controls, visuals, and interacvtivity that we have
        on today's internet. This means that the user is unable to communicate the information back to 
        those who produced the content. Examples of Web 1.0 include personal sites and static websites.</p>
        <p style="color : rgb(0,0,128); text-indent: 5%; font-size:20px">Web 2.0, also referred to as the
        social-web or the read-write web, is a type of web that took place in the era of 2000-2010 
        (still continues today). This type of web facitilitates interaction between the web users and sites,
        which, as a result, allows users to communicate with other users. Examples of this type of web includes
        applications like Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, etc.</p>
        <p style="color : rgb(0,0,128); text-indent: 5%; font-size:20px">Web 3.0, or the read-write-execute web,
        is a type of web of the era 2010 and later, which refers to the future of the web. Computers can interpret
        information like humans, in this era, by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning. These
        sources allow the generation and distribution of useful content and information made for the specfic need 
        of the user. This can include helping us learn what we are interested in, assist us in finding what we want,
        recognition of people, events, places, products, and movies, and it can understand the relationship between 
        things. Examples of this include Apple's Siri, Alexa, Wolfram Alpha, etc.</p>

    <h2>What is the role of markup languages in the web?</h2>
        <p style="color: rgb(0,0,128); text-indent: 5%; font-size:20px">HTML (hypertext markup language) is the most 
            basic building block of the web, in that it defines the structure and meaning of the web 
            content and information. Other markup languages besides HTML can be used to describe the 
            appearance and how the information is presented of the website (i.e., CSS). It can also 
            describe how complex features are implemented and how the web functions (i.e., JavaScript).</p>
    <h2>How are markup and scripting langauges similar? How are they different? </h2>    
        <p style="color:rgb(0,0,128); text-indent: 5%; font-size:20px">Scripting languages gives the script to perform 
            some certain task. It is used to give guidance to another program or or even control another 
            program. This connects one language to one other language as it doesn’t as a stand-alone. 
            Markup languages a different from scripting languages in that they prepare a structure for the
            data or the appearance/design of the page, which doesn’t require the use of any logic or 
            algorithm. The similar thing about these two languages is that both are building blocks for 
            creating a website. </p>
    <h2>The different types of markup languages:</h2>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li style="color:rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px; padding-left:0">Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)</li>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li style="color:rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px">In the family of markup languages, this form can be
            best described as the 'parent'. SGML provides a way to define markup languages and set their standards 
            for their form, stating and instructing what they can and cannot do, the elements that must be included 
            (i.e. tags), and the basic structure of the language. Just like how a child posseses the genetic
            traits of their parents, other markup languages possess the structure and format rules from SGML.</li>
        </ul>    
        <li style="color:rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</li>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li style="color:rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px; padding-left:0">Known as the 'child', or an application of 
            SGML, Hypertext Markup language gives the ability to embed images, establish fonts, create page 
            sections, etc. You can also add additional functions to a website with scripting languages like
            JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
        <li style="color:rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px; padding-left:0">Extensible Markup Language (XML)</li>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li style="color:rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px">A cousin to HTML and nephew to SGML, an XML markup
            language differs from HTML, in that, being a subset of SGML, it possesses some traits from 
            SGML that a language like HTML does not have. For example, XML has the ability to make subsets 
            (in other words, their own family) just like SGML, but HTML is limited to design and
            it does not have subsets or applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <li style="color:rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px; padding-left: 0">Extensible Hypertect Markup Language (XHTML)</li>

            <li style="color:rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px">A stricter, more XML based version of HTML,

        <li style="color:rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px; padding-left:0">Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML)</li>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li style="color:rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px;">Rather than being a markup language,
            DHTML is term used to refer to the combination of features of various web development technologies
            that are used to help create dynamic and interactive web pages.</li>

    <h2>A little bit about myself and my background</h2>
        <p style="color:rgb(0,0,128); text-indent: 5%; font-size:20px"> Some of my interests include math and art. My values
        are my family, staying organized, working hard and doing well in school. I also value honesty, trustworthy people 
        in my life like friends, kindness, and freedom. One thing that I have always believed in is that if you work hard 
        for something, it will eventually lead to success. Staying organized is something that I find essential in this case because 
        I am disorganized somehow, I find it hard to clear up my mind trying to focus on other things. 
        This is why I value working hard and staying organized.

        <p style="color:rgb(0,0,128); text-indent: 5%; font-size:20px">I don't think I have any interests in doing something like web
        designing because as I progressed in making my website, there were a lot of complex things, such as lots of formatting issues that 
        I had to deal with. Personally, I don't think that the skills required in this module were the best for me personally based on my
