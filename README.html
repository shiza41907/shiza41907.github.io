    <h2>Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms, outlining how this
        protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships.</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px; ">When computers connect and transmit data between each other, they
        have to follow a set of rules to do
        so. These rules are made unviersally so that all computers can use them. These rules are called protocols.
        There are many different protocols made for different purposes. 'Internet Protocol Suite' is the term we
        use to refer to the protocols all together. The two most important protocols are Transmission Control
        Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), which helps in making sure that data is delivered at the
        correct place without any errors.</p>
    <h2>List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships.</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li style="color : rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px">Websites (ie: Instagram or Pinterest websites)</li>

    <h2>What is hypertext?</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px">Hypertext is a text that contains links to other texts, information
        or graphics. These texts
        can be typically accessed by the point-and-click method.</p>
    <h2>How is “the web” related to the internet?</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px">The web" is used on top of the infrastructure of the internet, in
        that "the web", also
        referred to as the World Wide Web, is a collection of information that is accessed via the internet.</p>
    <h2>How is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used to facilitate client/server interaction?</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(0,0,128); font-size:20px">The HTTP client (a browser is an example) intiates a HTTP request
        towards the server. Once the
        request is made,the client waits for the response. The server then processes the request by displaying the
        requested objects. This means that if the client makes a request for HTML pages towards the server, then
        the server will request the process by displaying the requested HTML pages.</p>
